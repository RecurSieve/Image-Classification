# Image-ClassificationðŸ¦‹

This project aims to build and train a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch for an image classification task. The original dataset can be found on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species?resource=download&select=test . From the original dataset, I have created a subdataset taking into consideration the top 11 classes in terms of number of images. It consists of 1816 color images (224Ã—224 pixels) of butterflies and moths, across 11 classes.

Given the limited data, the project emphasizes strategies to mitigate overfitting, including data augmentation and a carefully designed architecture.

Inspired by models such as GoogLeNet, the network will incorporate inception-style modules to capture multi-scale features, while deliberately avoiding simpler architectures like multilayer perceptrons or LeNet. The project workflow includes data preprocessing, designing the CNN, training it entirely from scratch, and evaluating its performance.
